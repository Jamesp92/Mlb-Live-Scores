# MLB Game Tracker for NZXT Kraken

## Overview

This web application is designed to provide real-time updates on MLB games, with a current focus on Seattle Mariners games. Integrated with the NZXT Kraken's CPU cooler web interface, it uses the SportsDB API to display upcoming games and live scores. The application is built with Vite and React, ensuring a responsive and dynamic user experience.
